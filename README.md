# NetspherePirates
A unfinished and unstable S4 League server emulator for patch 26(Season 1). I stopped actively working on this project so i decided to make this project open source. I'll be working on this from time to time depending on how i feel. Everyone is welcome to contribute :).

### Requirements
* .Net Framework 4.6(.1)
* MySQL
* Windows(or linux using a nightly mono build)
* S4 League client patch 26: [Download coming soon-ish](https://github.com/wtfblub/NetspherePirates)
